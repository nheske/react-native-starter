Based on the excellent video [React Native Tutorial #2 (2021) - Creating first app with Expo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Csi_0rh5I&list=PLqGdu3H2yIjax3haGsMs2MST6zD4Pux9Y&index=10)

I created project with 
```
    expo init hello-react-expo
```

To run:
```
    cd hello-react-expo
    yarn start 
```
